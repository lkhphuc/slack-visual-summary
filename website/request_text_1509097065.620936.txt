Good idea. We could meet on Monday or Tuesday. Which day would you prefer <@U5C0XNQBW> ?
Tuesday would be good for me.
I'm sorry, but I'm a little busy on Tuesday. Can we go on Monday though?
Sure, I can change my schedule a bit. Monday is also good.
OK. Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon?
I think the afternoon would be best.

That will work out. I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow. I need you to bring your plans with you. <@U5C0XNQBW> <@U5GT9QU82>
Yes, I will bring my plans with me to the meeting.
I am finish it right now.
Would you like to meet at the office or at a coffee shop?
Coffee shop of course, the office is boring.
It has to be at the office, we need some document from there as well.
Fine. Do you need a ride to the office?
No thanks,I can get there on my own.
Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there?
I feel that the whole committee needs to be there.
Yes, I agree. We'll make sure that they get notified.
Great! We will send you all the details later. Looking forward to meeting with you! <@U5C0XNQBW> <@U5GT9QU82>
