<@U5C0XNQBW> <@U5GT9QU82> Hey guys, let's meet up this Saturday
Sure, what's the occasion?
It's our graduation day, of course.
Definitely, at what time should we gather?
I got off from work at 5pm, so we should meet up at 6.
Wait, I will still be in class at 6pm, let's meet at 6:30 then <@U5GT9QU82> .
It's okay for me, I will just hang around till then. How about you, Phuc?
Cool, I'm free the entire day actually, so no worry.
Perfect, 6:30pm it is then!
Great, where should we go?
I know an amazing sushi restaurant in District 1.
I don't really like sushi, how about we try something else?
Yea, I don't like sushi either. Raw fish is weird!
What do you suggest then?
Anyone fancy for some Chinese food? There's a new opening restaurant right down my street!
Chinese are okay, but I'm actually in the mood for French cuisine,
I'm not so sure, it might be too expensive.
okay, let's try to find something we all enjoy.
yea, I agree.
How about some pizza?
That's a great idea.
Absolutely, I like pizza too.
Great, pizza it is then!
Anyone know a good pizza place?
Let's try that place Pizza 4P in District 3. I heard they had great reviews.
Fantastic, Pizza 4P at 6:30pm
Try not to be late, okay? <@U5GT9QU82> <@U5C0XNQBW>
Sure, see you there!
okay, goodbye.
Bye
