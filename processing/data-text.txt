Here's a case study for Intelligence Program 3 (if we still focus on students as main manpower)"
//www.kainos.com/careers/student-and-graduates/aicamp. Shorten the 6-month program to 2-week camp --&gt; same investment 7,000 - 8,000$, enough time and evidence to identify talents"
Kainos A.I.Camp - machine learning | Kainos: This year we are launching A.I.Camp, a brand new summer camp for students to learn the foundations of artificial intelligence."
<@U5C0XNQBW> My imagination for IP3 is to bring it under AI Labs inside university. Much lower investment effort with the same (or even higher) reach. Then create another event (maybe your idea above) to inspire &amp; engage"
How can students from different uni can join Lab under 1 uni? Or we just to invest in the top 5 uni labs?"
True, investing in several labs might be needed. For beginning, top 2 or 3 already too good if we can go deeply into the student network with great branding"
more importantly, its easier to engage junior/senior researcher within the university (senior means professor, junior means Master/PhD students)"
<http://www.thedataincubator.com/|www.thedataincubator.com/> another case study The Data Incubator Applied Data Science Education"
I prefer this one. They collaborate with giants to provide fellowship, training and hiring."
Cool! Could you summarize their model? <@U5C0XNQBW>"
and how do you think it would be customised and suited to us?"
these ideas are important for the next national HR planning this weekend."
Anyway, For summary #1. Labs inside uni #2. 2-week bootcamp #3. Incubator for fellowship, training and hiring #4. Engineering Blog"
<@U5C0XNQBW> Hiring strategy from now on will be categorized into `Reach - Inspire - Engage - Convert`. Below instruction is the guidance to present your ideas during any discussion (especially this week meeting)"
*1. Reach* main purpose is to raise awareness of what were doing, how Cinnamon is different from others, what the vision is and how Cinnamon is potentially changing the business operation in the future
*2. Inspire* creating excitement to follow Cinnamon ideas (AI product-approached, products to change business operations, AI will the future, etc.) or to join Cinnamon (position Cinnamon as top employer in the market)
*3. Engage* any form of short-term &amp; long-term cooperation to let external people to experience a part of what were doing, what were aiming for
*4. Convert* straight forward talks to interview &amp; offer"
Any ideas should have 1 ultimate objective (and maybe several side objectives). Ultimate objective should be categorized within 1 of the 4 phases above"
I see."
From Talent Acquisition point of view, which is different with Hiring, it includes"
Talent Acquisition Planning and Strategy, which we shall do this Saturday"
Workforce Segmentation"
Employment Branding --&gt; *Reach* and *Inspire* (Building Brand love)"
Candidate Relationship Management ( networking and relationship building) --&gt; *Engage*"
Metrics and Analytic (to make better recruitment decision) --&gt; *Convert*"
Final outcome is a sustainable talent pool"
Sustainable talent pool is a must. But its not the final outcome."
Timely having talent to join Cinnamon as business demand is the final outcome"
outcome of TA job, as I understand"
Hiring belongs to other role"
those 2 cant be separated"
great strategy in hiring is not just picking up people. Its not the sustainable way to do."
We decide to invest in longer-term by building a strong ecosystem to support talents."
Although you might take a part of the whole processes from building talent pools until hiring, and the other direct hiring parts belong to someone else"
the entire team should stills stick to the ultimate objective"
Of course the ultimate goal is hiring. However, in term of scope of work and KPIs, final outcome of TA role is talent pool"
I am willing to support any department. But we need to clarify role of each team member as the company is on the way to reach a higher level of organizational structure"
<@U5C0XNQBW> We can talk about this with the new Assistant HR manager, this decision can be delayed for 1 - 2 weeks. And it's going to be her team, so let's work this out"
Basically whether we should divide the TA job vertically or horizontally."
